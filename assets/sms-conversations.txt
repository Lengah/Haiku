-Hi Jack. What are you doing?
+Hi Mary. I'm filling out a job application.
-Are you finished with school already?
+No. I have one more semester, but it would be great to have a job lined up.

$
+How is your day going?
-Quite busy. I'm preparing for my presentation tomorrow on our marketing strategy. I'm not even half done yet.
+You must feel stressed out now.
-That's an understatement.

$
+What are you doing now?
-I'm playing pool with my friends at a pool hall.
+I didn't know you play pool. Are you having fun?
-I'm having a great time. How about you? What are you doing?
+I'm taking a break from my homework. There seems to be no end to the amount of work I have to do.
-I'm glad I'm not in your shoes.

$
-I saw you standing here, and I just had to come tell you you have the most striking sense of style I've seen all day. I'm Joe.
+Hi... I'm Tina.
-Hi Tina. How's your night going?
+Okay. How's your night going?
-It's going all right. So tell me, New York native or you come from somewhere far away?
+Nope, I'm New York, born and raised.
-Ah, all right. So you know all the secret places the tourists and I can only guess about.
+Her: Where are you from?
-Right now or originally?
+Um... right now.
-Right now I'm a New York native. Well, not native, but I live here, if that counts for anything.
+How long have you lived here?
-That's a good question, how long have I lived here? Umm... I guess about two years, yeah? What do you do here in the City?
+I'm a paralegal.
-Oh cool, cool. Does that mean you aspire to be a lawyer someday, or you see how much work your boss has to do and say, "Never for me?"
+I might be a lawyer someday. Actually, I do more work than he does, and it's all the hard stuff, too.
-You like it?
+It's okay.
-Okay, well, why are you doing a job that's just okay? Why not find one that's amazing?
+There are no amazing jobs. :p
-There's got to be an amazing job out there somewhere.
+Like what?
-Like... well, I don't know. If you could do anything else in the world and get paid the same as what you get paid now, what would you do instead?
+Hmm, well... maybe I would work as a vet.
-A veterinarian?
+Yeah.
-Wow, that's different from being a paralegal. What, you signed up for the wrong school or something by accident?
+No, I just thought there was more opportunity to make a better salary in the law. :p
-I see. Think you'll stay in the legal profession forever?
+Ehm... maybe like five to ten years.
-Then what?
+I don't know, that's a long time from now. What do you do? 
-Him: I'm an artist; do some creative stuff.
+Like what?
-Paint, mostly. Take some photographs. I'd like to get my own studio up.
+Really? I love photography.
-She's actively seeking to bond with him over his artistic pursuits.
+Oh, no way. You take pretty good pictures?
-No, I'm terrible! I can't even use a digital camera.
+Ah, you can't be that bad! You must have at least some good pictures.
-No, really. All my pictures suck!
+Well, sometime I'll give you some pointers. :) What else do you do creative? 
-Not really anything.
+There must be something.
-No, really! I'm the most uncreative person on Earth.
+Well, you do a lot of hard work for a law firm. You've got to get creative to get some of it done sometimes.
-Maybe. Well, I do draw. More like doodle. Does that count?
+Of course. Millions of ways you can be creative.
-So do you make money through photography?
+No, actually, I'm kind of a struggling artist. I have a day job, which is what I lean on for the bills, but I don't like being defined that way so I'll always say I'm an artist.
-What's your day job?
+I manage projects at a company downtown.
-Oh, that's good.
+No way! It's boring as hell. I want my photography to take off so I can stop riding a desk all day, falling asleep in front of my computer.
-I do that too. :D
+Yeah, seriously. How'd we end up trading our time for money? I wanted to be James Bond and go travel the world, killing bad guys and seducing beautiful women.
-You'd be great at that, I think. Let me know if you do that, maybe I'll go with you for a few missions. :)
+You can be my Bond girl.
-Totally.
+Too bad the Bond girl is different in every movie. I kind of like you.
-haha :)
+Maybe I'll lobby the writers to keep you around for two movies. Like, a sequel or something.
-haha you're funny :)
+Hey, let's grab a seat before we get run over up here. There's a couch right over there.
-Okay.
+So tell me about yourself; I don't know anything about you.
-Okay... what do you want to know?
+Well, for one, do you travel?
-No. Do you?
+A little bit.
-Where have you been?
+A bunch of places. Well, tell me this: if you could go anywhere you wanted in the world, where would you go?
-Umm... Europe, maybe?
+Like, where in Europe?
-Spain. I think Spain would be so romantic and wonderful. And I love Spanish food.
+And Spanish men, perhaps.
-Spanish men are a little too lazy for me;)
+Ay caramba.
-haha :)
+It sounds amazing. I want to go!:p
-You will. Maybe Italy will be where we do our James Bond mission.
+The first one or the second one?
-Well, let's plan for the first one; I'm not sure if the writers will let me have the same girl in two movies yet or not.
+hehe :p 
-Again, he's hard to get but on her side.
+So you're not much of a traveler. What do you do for fun?
-I play board games sometimes.
+Oh my god.
-haha
+Seriously though. ;)
-Well, you know... hang out with friends, go to movies, eat at restaurants. Clubbing sometimes...
+Apparently.
-Yeah, well. Not that much... ^^
+Just four days a week.
-No! Maybe a couple times a month; that's it! :p
+I believe you. You probably know every bartender and doorman here. They're like, "It's Tina!"
-hihi :)
+What else do you do?
-Umm... that's about it.
+Okay, cool.
-What do you do?
+Mostly just chill. My life is pretty boring and uninteresting; I just like to make it sound exciting. Can't even remember the last time I had a near-death experience...
-Oh my god...! :D
+Family live in the City still? 
-Mom and dad are in Queens.
+Brothers and sister?
-One brother; he moved out to California.
+Smart man. He likes sunshine and fake boobs, I'm guessing.
-That sounds about right. ^^
+How is it growing up as a precocious little girl in NYC?

+No, I'm from Jackson.
-Oh yeah ? Jackson, Mississipi ?
+No, Jackson, Minnesota.
-I didn't know there's a Jackson, Minnesota !
+Yes. There is a town in Minnesota called Jackson.

$
-Hello ? Can I talk to Mike Anderson please ?
+Mike isn't in yet. Should I have him call you back when he comes in ?
-Well, this is Bob from Fabulous Furniture. We were supposed to deliver a desk this morning.
+Oh, that's fine. You can come by and I'll have the manager let you in.
-Great. I would appreciate it.
+No problem. Is there anything else I could help you with ?
-That's about it. Thanks !
+Sure. I'll call the building manager right away.
-Sounds good. We'll see you in a bit then.
+Is the manager around ? I haven't been able to get a hold of her.
-No, she won't be coming in today. She called in sick this morning. Talk to Mike if you need something.

+Definitely. We'll come in an hour.

+Hi Jerry. The school year is almost over. Do you have any plans for the summer holiday?
-I'm planning on sleeping all day, every day! :p
+Oh, come on Jerry, you must be kidding.
-Yeah, I'm just pulling your leg. Actually, I'm going to go up to Sollentuna outside Stockholm.
+Really? Why would you go to Sollentuna? It's not a very popular tourist site.
-Exactly! It's not very popular, so it won't be too crowded. I enjoyed my trip to central Stockholm, but there were so many people there. I think it spoiled the atmosphere a bit.
+I'm sure Sollentuna won't be so crowded. But won't it be too hot in the summer?
-No, according to one of my students, it's very cool in the summer. He said it is "naturally air conditioned".
+Well, that sounds good. I wouldn't mind getting away from the Beijing heat myself. Still, I wonder... is there anything worth seeing in Sollentuna?
-Sure! For one thing, there's the beautiful natural scenery. I'm sure you've heard of Edsviken.
+Yes, I have heard of Edsviken, but won't you get bored just looking at the scenery?
-Come on Fay, there's lots of things to do. I can go hiking at the country side, go into Stockholm and do shopping, lots of stuff! :)
+Gee, when you describe it like that, it sounds really interesting!
-And that's not all. I'll be able to eat very delicious typical Swedish food, and my student told me I can meet some very beautiful women there!
+I'm sure you'll have fun Jerry, but let me give you some advice. Be sure to hold onto your wallet AND your heart! ;)
-We'll see what happens! :p
+Do you have a place to stay in Sollentuna?
-Yes, I'm very lucky. My student's sister is the manager of the Scandic Hotel there, the best hotel in town. I've seen some pictures on the Internet, it's really nice!
+That's great, Jerry. I'm looking forward to seeing your photos when you get back. :)

$
-Fay, I heard that people have to bargain whenever they go shopping in China. Is that true?
+Well, you don't have to bargain when you go to a department store or a supermarket, but in most other places, you can try to get a better price.
-We rarely do that in the States. I'm not really sure how to do it. Could you give me some pointers.
+Sure, it's easy. Anybody can do it. The first thing you must do is some research. Ask around and find out what a fair price is for what you want to buy. When you know what a normal price is, you are ready to bargain.
-That makes sense. If I don't know what a fair price is, the seller can ask for any price, and I would probably pay it! So, now I'm ready to go to a market. What's next?
+First, ask how much something is. In Chinese that's, "Duo xiao qian?". If the price is much higher than you're willing to pay, say so. In Chinese you would say "Tai guay le". Then you ask for a lower price. You should offer less than what you really want to pay.
-That way, I can bargain up to my price, right?
+Right! The seller will make a counter-offer. If you think it's still too high, and the seller refuses to go any lower, just walk away. If the seller is really able to meet your price, he or she will call you back. In that case, don't give in. Keep trying to get your price.
-What if the seller doesn't call me back?
+You can alway try again with the next vendor. If the seller's last price is not too high, you might accept it. Just be sure you don't pay too much!
-That seems pretty easy. Bargaining sounds like a lot of fun!
+It is! And just like with learning a language, you'll get better at it the more you practice.

-Tom was driving to a meeting.
+Oh, I see. What did you do yesterday?
-I met the representatives from Driver's in the morning. In the afternoon, I worked on the report and was just finishing when you telephoned. What did you do?
+Well, at 9 I had a meeting with Ms Anderson. After that, I did some research.
-Sounds like a boring day!
+Yes, I don't really like doing research. But it needs to be done.
-I agree with you on that, no research - no business!
+Tell me about the report. What do you think of it?
-I think the report is a good. Tom believes it's good, too.
